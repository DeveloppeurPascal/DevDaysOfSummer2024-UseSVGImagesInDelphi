# Creating an animation with SVG images

The sample "MaleCharacterSVGWalkingAnimation" is available in [Delphi FMX Game Snippets](https://github.com/DeveloppeurPascal/Delphi-FMX-Game-Snippets/).

It uses [toon characters 1](https://kenney.nl/assets/toon-characters-1) SVG files from [Kenney](https://kenney.nl/) to animate a person walking.

The SVG are stores in a unit as source code with SVG Folder To Delphi unit program.
The animation is available as a TFrame with classic properties.
The sample has a switch to start or stop the animation.

This animation has been coded [live on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/patrickpremartin). The replay is available on [Serial Streamer](https://serialstreameur.fr/afficher-des-animations-dans-un-projet-firemonkey-a-partir-de-fichiers-svg.html).
